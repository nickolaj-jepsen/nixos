# Working preferences

Repository-local instructions and existing conventions take precedence over these defaults.

## Environment

- This machine runs NixOS. Persistent system or user configuration belongs in `~/nixos`; do not use `apt`, global npm/pip installs, or edit `/etc`.
- For one-off tools, use `nix run nixpkgs#<tool>` or `nix shell nixpkgs#<tool>`.

## Tooling

- Prefer uv for Python and pnpm for Node, but defer to whatever the repo already uses.
- Prefer rebase over merge — even when asked to "merge" — unless a merge over rebase is explicitly requested.
- Never discard uncommitted work or force-push without approval.
- Prefer `gh` for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, API).
- In Digital-Udvikling repositories, use `ds` when it supports the operation; check `ds --help` when uncertain.

## Code style

- Comment only non-obvious intent, constraints, gotchas, or tradeoffs. Keep comments to one line when possible.
- Docstrings define the symbol's behavior, parameters, return value, errors, and invariants. Do not restate the signature or describe callers; guidance on when to call it is fine.
