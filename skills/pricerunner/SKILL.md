description: Search and compare Danish prices on PriceRunner.dk — product search with facet filters (brand, price range, specs), category browsing and sorting, shop offers incl. shipping, price history ("is this a good price?"), reviews, spec comparison, similar products and current price drops. Use when the user asks what something costs in Denmark, where to buy it cheapest, whether a price is good, to find/compare products by specs, or mentions PriceRunner.

# PriceRunner.dk

`scripts/pricerunner.py` wraps PriceRunner's unofficial frontend JSON API (no auth, stdlib Python). Every command prints one line of compact JSON; pipe through `jq` to trim. Prices are DKK. The API is reverse-engineered from the site's JS and can break without notice — if a command starts returning HTTP 404/400, say so rather than guessing.

## Commands

| Command                                                                         | Use                                                                                                                                         |

| `search "<q>" [-c CAT] [-f ID=VAL]… [-n N] [--no-extract]`                      | Free-text search. Returns products, the filters PriceRunner applied, and `facets` (filter ids + option ids) to refine with.                 |
| `categories [REGEX] [--kind cl\|sub\|tree]`                                     | Category tree (cached 7 days). Find the `cl` id for a product type.                                                                         |

| `facets CAT ID… [-g REGEX] [-f …]`                                              | Option ids + product counts for those filters; ranges get min/max buckets. Pass `-f` to see counts under current filters.                   |
| `list CAT [--sub SUB] [-q TEXT] [-f …] [-s SORT] [-n N]`                        | Browse a category, sorted (`PRICE_ASC`, `PRICE_DESC`, `RATING`, `POPULARITY`, `PRICE_DROP`, `TREND`, `NAME`). Also returns `subcategories`. |
| `offers PRODUCT [--international] [--used] [--all-stock] [--sort total\|price]` | Shop offers, default Danish in-stock new, cheapest incl. shipping first.                                                                    |
| `history PRODUCT [-i ONE_WEEK…INFINITE_DAYS] [-m MERCHANT] [-p POINTS]`         | Daily lowest price: current, all-time-in-window low/high/median, `currentPercentile` (0 = cheapest ever seen), downsampled series.          |

`PRODUCT` accepts a bare id (`3216399795`), `94-3216399795`, or a pricerunner.dk `/pl/` URL.

## Filters

`-f` takes `ID=VALUE` and is repeatable; the `af_` prefix is added for you.

- Options (OR within one filter): `-f BRAND=162,1766`
- Range: `-f PRICE=500_1500`, `-f PRICE=_1500` (max only), `-f PRICE=2000_` (min only). Same for numeric spec filters (e.g. battery hours).
- Rating: `-f RATING=4_`
- In stock only: `-f ONLY_IN_STOCK=true` (works in `list`; `search` ignores it)

Filter ids are numeric for specs (e.g. `59671607` = IP-klasse in headphones) and per category — always look them up with `filters` then `facets`; never guess option ids.

Category scoping differs by command: `search -c 94` or `search -c 100003567-100014541` (sub id); `list 94 --sub 100003567-100014541`.

## Workflow

1. **Vague request** ("cheap noise-cancelling earbuds"): `search` first. Its `appliedParams` shows what PriceRunner auto-extracted from the query (often an `af_CATEGORY`); pass `--no-extract` if that narrowed wrongly. Use `categoryId` from the results for the next steps.
2. **Spec-driven request** ("laptop with 32 GB RAM under 10.000 kr"): `categories 'bærbar'` → `filters 27` → `facets 27 <ramId> -g 32` → `list 27 -f <ramId>=<optId> -f PRICE=_10000 -s PRICE_ASC`.
3. **"Where do I buy X cheapest?"**: `offers`. Quote `total` (price + shipping), stock and delivery days; mention `--international` if `summary.internationalOffer.minPrice` is notably lower.
4. **"Is this a good price / should I wait?"**: `history -i ONE_YEAR` (or `TWO_YEARS`). Compare `current` with `lowest` and `median`; a low `currentPercentile` means it is near its cheapest. Note seasonal dips (Black Friday, November) visible in `series`.
5. **Cheapest-first listings** (`-s PRICE_ASC`) surface miscategorised junk and one-shop marketplace listings. Set a realistic `PRICE` minimum and prefer products with several `merchants`, or sort by `POPULARITY`/`RATING` and filter by price instead.
6. **Choosing between models**: `compare` for differing specs, `info` for review scores and pro pros/cons.

Present a short answer with product names, prices and pricerunner.dk links — not raw JSON. Offer `url`s go through Klarna's clickout redirect; prefer linking the product page `url` from `search`/`list`/`info`.
